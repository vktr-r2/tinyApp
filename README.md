# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).  App allows user to register and create a user profile.  Once registered, user can add/edit/delete URLs and store them within their own profile.  Storage of URLs and user profiles is currently limited to being stored in "database" objects within the server.
